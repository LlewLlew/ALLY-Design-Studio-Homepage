# ALLY Design Studio Homepage
 
 This is my solution for Codecademy's Company Home Page Challenge Project aimed to build a company's page using CSS and Flexbox. I've decided to build a page for an imaginary design studio named ALLY.
 
 You can see the page here: https://llewllew.github.io/ALLY-Design-Studio-Homepage/
